	<h3>What is Deforestation?</h3>
	<p>
		Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees to make room for something besides forest.Sometimes trees are removed for agriculture, construction or manufacturing. One of the most dangerous and unsettling effects of deforestation is the loss of animal and plant species due to their loss of habitat.In addition to the loss of habitat, the lack of trees also allows a greater amount of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. The tropical rainforests of South America are responsible for 20% of Earthâ€™s oxygen.If we continue to cut trees there will be less water in the air to be returned to the soil. This causes dryer soil and the inability to grow crops.

It also provides 13.4 million people with jobs in the forest sector, and another 41 million people have jobs related to forests.The trees also help control the level of water in the atmosphere by helping to regulate the water cycle.
