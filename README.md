# AMA
AMA is a group of members who targets the public about our current situation. Git repository is a data structure used by VCS to store metadata for a set of files and/or directories. It stores the set of a file as well as the history of changes made to those files. It is great for collaborating with others. Since it saves the history of changes that have been made to that file it is useful because you can always go back to the original if you donâ€™t like the change that has been made. Two special features of a git repository are that it allows you to work together with your teammates in the same file. Another special feature is that it saves the changes that have been made therefor if you have made a change that you don't like and would like to go back you go to the history undo the change. Those features help my group by allowing us to help each other with the code and checking the changes that have been made by our teammates.
