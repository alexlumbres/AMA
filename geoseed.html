			<h2>What is GeoSeed?</h2>
			<p>GeoSeed is a type of bomb that contain seeds and/or a tree. For the bomb to work, it must first be carried by a plane, where the plane would fly to a certain altitude.

Geoseed's purpose is to create an effecient way of planting seeds and/or trees to the ground without manually doing it by a person or machine.</p>
